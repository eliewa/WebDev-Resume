        <ul>
          <li>4-page website using Vanilla CSS, HTML and Javascript. 
            <strong>Site is deployed on GitHub pages -> <a href="https://eliewa.github.io/team-1/" target="_blank" class="btn">View Site</a></strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> In my Comp-260 course, for our final project I was placed in a group of three and given the task to build a fully responsive 4 page website and deploy it on github 
                within a fairly short time frame of a week.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Action:</strong> As I was elected to be the team leader of the project, I was tasked with creating a GitHub repository, project board and building a working template for each page as well as handling all the more complex functionality 
                of site. As I was very aware of the large time constraint we had, I immediately began the process by gathering all the necessary resources we would need for the project and making them available to the team members in the repository. 
                I then designed a prototype for the homepage and organized various meetings with team-member to get opinions, fixes and suggestions for improvements that could be made. 
                I aways made myself available to my team members for communication and I believe that was key to our overall success in this project.</li>
              <li><strong>Result:</strong> As the project came to an end, we were all very happy with the result. of course each of us had our own individual ideas but we all found a way to integrate with eachother and offer our individual talents to obtain the best 
                possible result. Overall we all grew as developers through this experience and I especially really began to understand the value of having a good organized team lead and diligent team members who communicate well and are willing to go above and beyond 
                on any particular task. I now carry this experience with me into any project I am involved in.</li>

          <li>
            VUE Film Database App with OMDB API.
            <strong>Project is Ongoing, link to GitHub Repository -> <a href="https://github.com/eliewa/final-project-v1" target="_blank" class="btn">Movie App Repository</a></strong><br>As a personal project I am currently working on a VUE film app that consumes the OMDB API and operates as a global film database similer to IMDB.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Problem:</strong> As we were learning how to create a VUE app in my Comp-262 course, I took the initiative to begin by creating a VUE movie database app. My goal for this project is to successfully utilize the OMDB API to create a dynamic Movie web application.</li>
              <li><strong>Action:</strong> The project is currently ongoing and will be completed by the first week of December, As of now I have created the basic site template in VUE and the next step will be to begin utilizing various OMDB API endpoints to dynamically display content.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>UI/UX Webpage mockups and design systems:</strong> Although I primarily like to focus on the programming side of web development, I also really enjoy making various design mockups and prototypes that may be useful for future projects. I believe my understanding of good web design practices 
            is something that distinguishes me from many developers who only focus on functionality. <strong>Here are some examples of my mockups -> </strong><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dbr1wHYEcf7yjwcRBoNhvu/Hero%2FMobile-first-achievement?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">Hero Section, </a>
